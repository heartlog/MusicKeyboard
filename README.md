# Musickeyboard🎵🎹

**MusicKeyboard** is a Python program that allows you to play random sound files when you press and release keys on your keyboard. The program uses the pynput.keyboard library to listen for key events and the winsound library to play the sound files.

## Installation 💻

To use **MusicKeyboard**, you need to have **Python** installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

You also need to install the **pynput** library. You can install it using **pip**:

```shell
pip install pynput
```

## Usage ⁉

```shell
## Clone the MusicKeyboard repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/heartlog/MusicKeyboard.git

# Navigate to the project folder:

```

Create two folders named `"sounds"` and `"sounds_release"` in the project folder. Place your sound files (in .wav format) in the respective folders. Make sure the files have the **.wav extension** .
